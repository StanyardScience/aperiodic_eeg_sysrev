Aperiodic and Hurst Exponent Systematic Review (): Plotting Figures

This repository is the code reference platform for the plotting functions used in the paper "Aperiodic and Hurst EEG exponents across early human brain development: a systematic review" by Stanyard et al (2024), submitted to Neuroscience and Biobehavioural Reviews (DOI: TBA). The functions provided here are for a bespoke plotting function capable of creating ellipsoid mapping of the variability in age and another defining feature, such as in this case, the aperiodic exponent. Being able to visualise the variation in both dimensions is incredibly helpful, and not something to my knowledge was available in existing python tools at the time of creation.

Given the potential novelty of this tool, we make this freely accessible to support the community, and as a companion tool to our paper. For improvement suggestions, collaboration or paper-related questions, please contact me directly at stanyardscience@gmail.com
